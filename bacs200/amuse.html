    <h1>Amusing</h1>
    <p>by Mallory Rosales</p>

    <p>The internet is obviously full of funny original content.</p>
    <p>These are some of my favorite funny memes, vines, and tiktoks from over the years.</p>

    <h2>Vine Compilation</h2>
    <p>Its been years since Vine went away but thankfully we have YouTube compilations.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40uMbKjSBwU">Vines that I literally cannot forget</a>

    <h2>Deer Meme</h2>
    <p>Another one I literally cannot forget for some reason.</p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/9x2l8g/buncha_hosers/">deer meme</a>

    <h2>TikTok</h2>
    <p>Just one of the many TikToks that most of us on the app could recognize anytime.</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZumKpD_LA8">So PICK Me, LOVE Me, CHOOSE Me tiktoks</a>
