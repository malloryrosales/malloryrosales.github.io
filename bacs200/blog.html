				<p>Since vaccines have been made available for covid-19, many people remain divided on whether or not they are safe, effective, or even necessary.</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>Equitable access to the vaccine was a concern for many after the initial release of the vaccines. Overtime, that has become less of an issue and now oppurtunities to be vaccinated are readily available. Now, the social implications of being vaccinated or not have become more of a concern. Many public and private organizations started to require vaccination to be allowed to particpate, be employed, or be allowed to attend events.
