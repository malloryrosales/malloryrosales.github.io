				<p>Since vaccines have been made available for covid-19, many people remain divided on whether or not they are safe, effective, or even necessary.</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p> Equitable access to the vaccine was a concern for many after the initial release of the vaccines. Overtime, that has become less of an issue and now oppurtunities to be vaccinated are readily available. Now, the social implications of being vaccinated or not have become more of a concern. Many public and private organizations started to require vaccination to be allowed to particpate, be employed, or be allowed to attend events. People who are unvaccinated may also simply be afraid of the social stigma that others may have about their vaccination status. Some people have gone as far as comparing vaccination cards to the star of david, which was actually a horrific representation of the religous persecution faced by jewish people during the holocaust. Although, there is no fair comparison between the two.

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p> Vaccinations can help the U.S workforce and economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Getting vaccinated can be considered an investment in society's health but also in the country's ongoing efforts for the economy to recover.

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>Politics afffect the publics ability to buy in on covid vaccines. Many are simply worried that the speed of the vaccine development is an indication that it was approved for reasons other than what is in the best interest of their health. The politicization of vaccines is a problem because a critical factor in so many people choosing to not get vaccinated is their politcal views. It is very important for public health, that moving forward we find ways to overcome political division and rebuild trust in science and health professionals.
