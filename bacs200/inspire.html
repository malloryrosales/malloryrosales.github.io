        Michelle Obama is inspirational to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        She was an extremely hardworking and talented first lady. She continues to be an advocate particulary for young adults and education even after leaving 
        the white house. She did not grow up with a lot of money but graduated from Ivy League colleges and became a successful lawyer. One of the reasons she
        inspires me is because she is a role model for being a hardworking career woman and mother. When I read her book "Becoming", I seen a glimpse of her life 
        with a prominent career while also being a mother.
